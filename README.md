# Color-Boxes-ReactJS

That app was super usefull for me to understand state arrays and updating state arrays. 
All the color data stored in colors(array) state in ColorArea component, then updated the indexes on ColorBox components onClick event.
So colorbox component doesnt have color state, it passed with props

<br>
Used colors 'extended colors'
